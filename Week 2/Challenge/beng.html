			<p>I'm currently in my third year of the Cyber Security & Digital Forensics BEng at Edinburgh Napier University.
                So far, I have covered modules on Network Security & Cryptography, Networked Services and Scripting for Cyber Security. I passed these with over 70% in Trimester 1.
                Now, in Trimester 2, I am working on Web Technologies, Computing in Contemporary Society and a Group Project module. Our group is doing a project to create a digital forensics scenario that can be used for educational purposes in the future.
