		<h1>You are... FRODO BAGGINS!</h1>
			<p> Don't doubt yourself, you may be the hero we all need. Like Frodo, you are indepdent and adventurous.</br>
				Your friends mean a lot to you, but you're always ready to go it alone. Stay open to help from others, they don't see you as the burden you fear you are.</br>
				With a curious mind, you love learning but would rather see it all for yourself. Maybe you keep a diary, or drawings, your memories are important to you, although some may be painful.</br>
				Your path may not be the same as everyone else, but your resilience, and determination will get you through.</br></p>
